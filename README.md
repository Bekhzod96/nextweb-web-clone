# theNextWeb
In this project, you’ll get the chance to build a responsive website. We’ll be cloning The Next Web, a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced.  The process will be quite similar to what we’ve done before. At this point, you should be much faster at setting up a site layout and positioning the elements than when you first started.
